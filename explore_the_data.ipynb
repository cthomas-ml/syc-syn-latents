    "\n",
    "In CCS, we aim to generate model embeddings for *both* answers to a given question. A probe is trained to contrast those two embeddings and determine which one is the 'truth.' \n",
    "Let's see how sensitive the model's response is to the way that we change the query to generate positive and negative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the two embeddings, we aim to manipulate the prompt in a way that it will answer the question with (A), and do a second manipulation to generate the answer (B). In this section we note that it is not straightforward to find a manipulation that determines the response of the full encoder-decoder model. This may not be a problem for CCS. Though our prompt manipulations aren't resulting in the desired model response, they can still lead to optimizable differences in the latent representations (some layer between the encoder and decoder).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We can go a lot deeper on this topic, with further prompt manipulations and explorations on 'red herring' prompt changes.  For more, see the CCS critique from Anthropic, referened in the main page of this repo.* \n",
